At the 1 hour and 24 minute mark of the episode, Peter and his guest discuss that early screenings for hearing loss are important because they believe that hearing loss contributes to nuerodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease. If Peter Attia and his guest are correct, then accurate screening strategies are needed to test for hearing loss at earlier stages of life in order to improve prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. This will require new and improved data analysis methods to interpret data correctly and efficiently."
